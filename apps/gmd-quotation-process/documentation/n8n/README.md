# n8n — Send Docket Email

The quotation board's **Send Email** column posts a `multipart/form-data` request
to an n8n Webhook. n8n relays it through a Gmail (OAuth) node, attaching the
generated Offer PDF.

## 1. Import the workflow

1. n8n → **Workflows → Import from File** → select
   `documentation/n8n/send-docket-email.workflow.json`.
2. Open the three Gmail nodes — **Get Thread**, **Reply** and **Send a
   message** — and pick (or create) a **Gmail OAuth2** credential for the
   sending account. All three must use the same mailbox.

## 2. Payload contract

The app (`lib/services/n8nEmail.ts`) sends these form fields:

| Field          | Meaning                                   | Used by         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `to`           | `Enquiry.senderEmail`                     | Gmail **To**    |
| `cc`           | `Enquiry.emailAddress` (comma-separated)  | Gmail **Cc**    |
| `subject`      | Offer subject line                        | Gmail Subject   |
| `html`         | Rendered HTML body                        | Gmail body      |
| `docketNumber` | Docket number (context/logging)           | —               |
| `fileName`     | PDF file name                             | Attachment name |
| `attachment`   | **binary** Offer PDF (`application/pdf`)  | Gmail attachment|
| `threadId`     | Gmail thread id to reply into (`DocketQuotationThread.threadId`) | Reply target |

n8n exposes the file as `$binary.attachment` (the form field name) and the text
fields under `$json.body` (e.g. `$json.body.to`, `$json.body.subject`). The
workflow responds `{ "success": true, "messageId": <gmail id> }`.

## 2b. Threading behaviour

The app resolves the RFQ thread for the docket and sends its `threadId`, so the
quotation is posted as a **reply inside that thread** instead of a new mail:

- `Has Thread` (true when `threadId` is present) → `Get Thread` fetches the
  thread → `Pick Last Message` picks the newest message **sent by the party**
  (`body.to`), falling back to the thread's first message (the original RFQ) when
  the party has none → `Reply` sends the offer as a reply (same thread).
  `Reply` has no To field: n8n derives the recipient from the message it replies
  to, so targeting the newest message would mail whoever wrote last in the
  thread — often an internal colleague, with the party dropped from the mail.
- If `Get Thread` or `Reply` fails — e.g. the sending mailbox is not a
  participant in that thread — its error output runs `Fallback Item`, which
  restores the original body + attachment, and `Send a message` mails it as a
  normal message so the quotation still goes out.
- When `threadId` is empty (no linked thread), `Has Thread` is false and it goes
  straight to `Send a message` (a new mail).

`Get Thread`, `Reply` and `Send a message` must all use the same Gmail account,
and that account must be able to read the linked thread for the reply path to run.

## 3. Activate + wire the URL

1. **Activate** the workflow (production webhook).
2. Copy the production URL, e.g.
   `https://<your-host>/webhook/send-docket-email`.
3. Put it in the app's `.env` (server-only):

   ```
   N8N_DOCKET_WEBHOOK_URL=https://<your-host>/webhook/send-docket-email
   ```

4. Restart the Next.js server so the new env var is picked up.

## 4. Test without the app

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<your-host>/webhook/send-docket-email" \
  -F "to=buyer@example.com" \
  -F "cc=accounts@example.com" \
  -F "subject=Offer For Supply" \
  -F "html=<p>Hello</p>" \
  -F "docketNumber=GMD-0001" \
  -F "fileName=Offer-GMD-0001.pdf" \
  -F "attachment=@./some-offer.pdf;type=application/pdf"
```

A `200` with `{"success":true,...}` means the app's `sendDocketEmailAction` will
persist `emailSentBy` and lock the row (Reset unlocks it).

## 5. Technical Evaluation Follow-up

A second workflow, **GMD Quotation - Technical Evaluation Follow-up**
(`workflow:2QWG8tG8Lpkjmgi5`), handles the 24-hour follow-up.

- **Trigger:** the dashboard POSTs JSON to `/webhook/tech-eval-followup`
  whenever a docket's *Technical Evaluation* is marked **Yes**. The app queues
  nothing unless the offer was already sent (`emailSentBy` set) and the docket
  has a client email.
- **Flow:** Webhook (acknowledges immediately) → **Wait 24 hours** → Gmail
  **Send a message** from `info@gmd`.
- **Payload** (`lib/services/n8nTechEvalFollowup.ts`): `docketNumber`, `to`,
  `cc`, `subject`, `html`, `markedAt`. Fields arrive as `$json.body.*`.
- **Cc:** the docket's email addresses plus `puja.agarwal@laserpowerinfra.com`
  (built by `lib/techEvaluationFollowup.ts`).
- **Env:** `N8N_TECH_EVAL_FOLLOWUP_WEBHOOK_URL`.
- Each Yes transition queues one follow-up; clearing Yes and marking it again
  queues another. Nothing is cancelled once queued.

## 6. Notes
- **Binary property:** the Gmail node attaches `$binary.attachment`. If your n8n
  version renames multipart files, open the Webhook node, enable the binary
  option, and set the property name to `attachment` (or update the Gmail node's
  attachment property to match).
- **Allowlist:** if the n8n instance restricts webhook origins, allow the app's
  origin (`NEXTAUTH_URL`).
- **Security (optional):** add a Header Auth credential on the Webhook node and
  send a shared secret from `n8nEmail.ts` via `headers` on the `fetch` call.
