/**
 * Scheduled job — pending docket creation, then duplicate cleanup.
 *
 * Two steps, both with their own containment: `runPendingDocketCreation` creates
 * dockets for new mail, and `runPendingDocketDedupe` deletes pending copies that
 * resolve to the same mail. The second step always runs, even when the first has
 * nothing to create, because older duplicates may still exist.
 *
 * The orchestrator owns an in-flight latch, because ofelia's `no-overlap = true`
 * cannot see a second app instance (or a future manual caller) sharing one
 * database; a concurrent run would allocate the same docket serials twice.
 *
 * Scheduled at :20, between `supply-history` (:15) and `contract-review` (:30),
 * so contract-review's same-hour pass can backfill `contractNo` on the dockets
 * this job creates.
