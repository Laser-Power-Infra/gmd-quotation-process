/**
 * Scheduled job registry — one entry per ofelia-driven sync.
 *
 * Each job is a sequential pipeline of steps. `gmd-update` runs:
 *
 *   1. `runGmdCatalogueSync()`      GMD UPDATION -> RawMaterial (create + diff)
 *   2. `runStockPhysSync()`         stock-phys   -> RawMaterial.availableStock
 *   3. `runRawMaterialItemNameSync()` ITEM MASTER ERP -> RawMaterial.itemNameAuto
 *   4. `runActiveBomRules()`        active Auto BOM rules -> Bom / BomItem
 *
 * Step 2 only makes sense once step 1 has landed, so the steps are strictly
 * sequential: a fatal failure in step 1 aborts before step 2 runs rather than
 * refreshing stock against a half-synced table. Step 3 fills `itemNameAuto`,
 * which step 1 no longer owns (it is excluded from NON_EDITABLE_FIELDS).
 *
 * All logic lives in this folder. `app/api/scheduler/**` contains nothing but
 * thin HTTP shims, because Next.js only routes `route.ts` files that sit under
 * `app/`.
 *
 * No module here imports from `@/app/actions` — that file is a `"use server"`
 * module and a route handler must not reach into one.
