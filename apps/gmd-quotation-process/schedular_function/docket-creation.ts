/**
 * Scheduled job step — pending docket materializer.
 *
 * Ported from `createPendingDocketsAction` in `app/actions/*.ts`, which is a
 * top-level `"use server"` module. A route handler must not reach into a server
 * action, so the algorithm was copied here rather than imported. The action is
 * kept (commented out) as legacy reference; this file is the scheduled source of
 * truth.
 *
 * The logic itself was already built on action-free `lib/` helpers, so there is
 * no genuine duplication of the algorithm — only of the orchestration:
 *   - `lib/docketNumber`              -> getFiscalPrefix / nextDocketSerials
 *   - `lib/pendingDocketMaterializer` -> party + email resolution
 *   - `lib/docketSnapshot`            -> mail attachment parsing
 *   - `lib/docketSnapshotPdf`         -> snapshot PDF render + Drive upload
 *   - `lib/enquiryEmailParty`         -> extractEmailsFromValue
 *
 * Full parity with the manual action: mail file attachments are linked as-is and
 * a mail-snapshot PDF is generated and uploaded to Google Drive per docket. A
 * failed snapshot is contained (counted in `snapshotFailures`) and never aborts
 * the docket itself.
 *
 * Item extraction: the subject, every message body, the attachment OCR text and
 * every attachment file are parsed for `{ itemName, quantity }` pairs, which are
 * created as `EnquiryItem` rows on the new docket. The deterministic parser runs
 * first; an opt-in AI fallback (`docket-item-extraction.ts`) runs only when the
 * parser finds nothing. A thread with no extractable items still gets a
 * header-only docket, exactly as before.

 * against previous dockets (falling back to the thread's `partyName` /

 *
 * Two limits, both deliberate:

 * - **Recent mail only (IST).** Today's mail plus the previous `BACKLOG_DAYS`
 *   IST days, because the ingestion can lag by a day. Anything older is left
 *   alone; this job never works through an unbounded backlog.
 * - **One docket per mail.** A candidate whose mail already has a docket is
 *   skipped, matched on `Enquiry.sourceThreadId`. This is the limit that matters:
 *   the stamp written on the thread below is *not* durable, because the external
 *   mail ingestion re-syncs the row and clears `docketNo` back to NULL with
 *   `pendingDocket = true` within the hour. Before `sourceThreadId` existed, one
 *   NCC mail was docketed 11 times, once per hourly run. The link lives on the
 *   `Enquiry`, which the ingestion never touches.
