/**
 * Scheduled job — Contract Review, five steps in order.
 *
 *   1.  `runContractReviewSheetSync()`     CONTRACTS + DUMP -> ContractReview
 *   1b. `runContractReviewItemNameSync()`  ITEM MASTER ERP -> ContractReview.itemName
 *   2.  `runContractReviewEnquirySync()`   Enquiry -> State / Utility / Project Ref
 *   3.  `runContractReviewRmAvailSync()`   stock-phys -> VerifyBom -> RM AVAIL -> PHYSICAL STOCK
 *   4.  `runIcDumpSync()`                  INSPECTION OFFER DUMP -> offer / inspection / DI
 *
 * The order is a real dependency chain, not cosmetic:
 *   - 2 depends on 1 for fresh contract rows to match Enquiry against.
 *   - 3 step 3 reads VerifyBom, whose `itemName` is sourced from
 *     `ContractReview.itemName` ordered by `syncedAt desc`
 *     (`lib/verifyBomLookup.ts:236`), so 1b runs before 3 to make the ITEM
 *     MASTER name available. `ContractReview.itemName` is in the sheet sync's
 *     SKIP_FIELDS, so only 1b writes it.
 *   - 3 step 4 needs `ContractReview.costCodeRef`, which job 1 cannot populate
 *     (it is absent from CONTRACTS_SHEET_COLUMNS) and which is published
 *     separately from the Indent Listing by `recomputeIndentListingVersionsAction`.
 *     If that has never run, step 4 resolves nothing and writes null.
 *   - 4 joins on `mcNo` + `itemCode`, both of which step 1 is what populates.
 *
 * Steps are strictly sequential. A fatal failure aborts the remaining steps
 * rather than running them against a half-updated table.
 *
 * Step 2 is normally a no-op: step 1 already applies the identical backfill
 * (`app/api/contract-review/sync/route.ts:233-234`). It is kept as its own step
 * because it is cheap and independently useful; `steps.enquiry.noOp` makes the
 * redundancy visible instead of silent.
 *
 * Note the work is split so that nothing runs twice per hour: VerifyBom and the
 * RM AVAIL recompute are owned by step 3 only, even though the manual SYNC route
 * also performs them.
