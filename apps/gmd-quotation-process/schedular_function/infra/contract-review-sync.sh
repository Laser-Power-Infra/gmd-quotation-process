# Runs the Contract Review sync, steps in order:
#   1.  CONTRACTS + DUMP sheet -> ContractReview
#   1b. ITEM MASTER ERP -> ContractReview.itemName
#   2.  Enquiry fields (State / Utility / Project Reference)
#   3.  RM AVAIL: raw-material stock, VerifyBom, RM AVAIL, PHYSICAL STOCK
#   4.  INSPECTION OFFER DUMP -> offer / inspection / DI
#
# Heavier than raw-material-sync.sh — two full-column spreadsheet reads and a
# large table rewrite — so it is scheduled at :30 rather than :00 to keep the two
# jobs from contending.
#
# Failure modes, all of which must fail the job:
#   - Non-200: wget itself exits non-zero, and `set -e` aborts the script.
#   - 200 whose body reports success=false: caught by the grep below.
#   - 200 with success=true but a partial failure: rows that failed to write
#     (`failedWrites`) or a side-effect stage that threw (`warnings`). The
#     orchestrator only reports success=false when a step THROWS, so without the
#     counter checks a half-written run would print OK.
#
# Env (set in the ofelia container, not committed):
#   GMD_APP_SERVER      base URL of this app, e.g. http://gmd-quotation-process:4570

set -eu

# Fail loudly when the secret is missing, rather than sending an empty
# `x-api-key:` header and getting back an opaque 401.
