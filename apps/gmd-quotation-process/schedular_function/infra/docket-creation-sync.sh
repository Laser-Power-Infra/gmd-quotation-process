# Materializes dockets for every recent DocketQuotationThread flagged
# pendingDocket = true (today plus the previous 5 IST days): creates a
# header-only Enquiry, links mail attachments, generates the snapshot
# PDF, and stamps the thread with the new docket number. The same run then
# deletes duplicate zero-item dockets for a mail that already has a docket.
#
# Idempotent: a stamped thread leaves the pending set, and a folded thread is
# skipped by duplicateOfDocket, so re-running is a no-op.
#
# Scheduled at :20, between supply-history (:15) and contract-review (:30), so
# contract-review's same-hour pass can backfill contractNo on the new dockets.
