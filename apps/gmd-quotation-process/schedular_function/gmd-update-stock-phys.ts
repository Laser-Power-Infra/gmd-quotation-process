/**
 * Scheduled step 2 — stock-phys `SUM OF PHYSICAL STOCK` -> availableStock.
 *
 * Ported from `scripts/sync-available-stock-from-stock-phys.ts:22-109`, which
 * is left untouched so `npm run stock:sync` keeps its current behaviour. This
 * version fixes three bugs in that script:
 *
 *   1. Case/whitespace mismatch. The script matched on
 *      `erpItemCode.trim().toUpperCase()` but then wrote with
 *      `updateMany({ where: { erpItemCode } })` — a case-SENSITIVE exact match.
 *      Any row whose stored code was lower-case or padded was reported as a
 *      change and then silently updated zero rows. Writes here are keyed on the
 *      primary key instead, so that class of mismatch cannot occur.
 *   2. Blank cells wiped real stock. The script compared
 *      `availableStock !== to` where `to` could be "", so a code present in
 *      stock-phys with an empty stock cell cleared the DB value to an empty
 *      string. A blank is skipped here: it never clears a stored value.
 *   3. Untrimmed comparison. `" 12 "` vs `"12"` registered as a change.
 *      Both sides are trimmed before comparing.
 *
 * `"0"` is deliberately treated as a real counted stock and is written, which
 * matches `syncNullVerifyBomStockAction` in `app/actions.ts`.
 *
 * Note that `SUM OF PHYSICAL STOCK` is a pre-aggregation maintained in the
 * Google Sheet (a pivot/QUERY result); nothing here sums anything itself.
