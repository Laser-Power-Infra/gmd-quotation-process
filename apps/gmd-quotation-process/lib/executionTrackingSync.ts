/**
 * Execution Tracking -> SupplyHistoryItem.
 *
 * The one engine behind all three entry points:
 *   - `scripts/sync-execution-tracking.ts` (`npm run exec:sync`, dry run by
 *     default, `--limit` for a smoke test),
 *   - `POST /api/supply-history/execution-sync` (the button's FY dropdown),
 *   - the `execution-tracking` scheduler job (current fiscal year).
 *
 * Source: the `SALE_BILL_GID` tab of `GMD_EXECUTION_TRACKING_SPREADSHEET_ID`.
 * `CONSIGNEE_ADD` and friends come straight off the row; `consigneeName` is
 * resolved through the local `acc_master` table (see `lib/accMasterLookup.ts`),
 * which the callers refresh first. `VRDATE` fills `date` on rows MASTER left
 * blank — see the write policy below.
 *
 * ── The sheet is a line ledger, the table is one row per (invoice, item) ──
 *
 * Measured on FY 2026-27: the sheet's 487 rows are 401 distinct
 * `(VRNO, ITEM_CODE)` pairs over 138 invoices — the same code is listed more
 * than once on an invoice (31 of those groups), because the sheet records each
 * issue line. `SupplyHistoryItem` holds **one** row per `(invoiceNo,
 * erpItemCode)`: that pair is unique in the year (0 duplicates), and the row's
 * `quantity` is the **sum** of the sheet's lines — verified on all 320 pairs the
 * two share, with zero exceptions.
 *
 * So the sync **merges the sheet's lines per `(invoiceNo, ITEM_CODE)` and sums
 * `QTYISSUED`** before diffing. Taking the first line instead would have written
 * `96` over a stored `627` (GD26Y-00014, three lines: 96 + 106 + 425) — a silent
 * regression in 23 of the 320 rows, which is exactly what the smoke test caught.
 *
 * ── Matching ──
 *
 * Exact `(invoiceNo, erpItemCode)`, which the data supports. A group with no
 * item code on the sheet falls back to matching by invoice number alone, and is
 * counted as `ambiguous` when that invoice owns several DB rows — writing one
 * line's quantity onto its siblings is worse than skipping, so it is not done.
 *
 * ── Write policy ──
 *
 *   - `quantity`, `uom`, `lrNoDt`, `consigneeAddress`, `erpItemCode` and
 *     `consigneeName` are overwritten when the sheet value is non-blank and
 *     differs. Blank cells — including `-` `--` `—` `–` — never clear a value.
 *   - `state` is written **only** when the sheet value is a recognised Indian
 *     state, and written in the DB's Title Case. Comparison is on the canonical
 *     form, so a row that already means the same thing (`Chattisgarh` vs
 *     `CHATTISGARH`) is never rewritten. An unrecognised value leaves the field
 *     alone and is counted in `stateSkipped`.
 *   - `date` is **gap-fill only**, from `VRDATE`: written when the DB cell is
 *     blank, never over a date the MASTER sheet supplied. It lands on inserts
 *     too, so a row this sync creates straight from SALE BILL carries its
 *     invoice date.
 *   - `financialYear` is set from `ACC_YEAR` on insert, and **gap-filled** on an
 *     existing row only when it is blank — a blank FY puts the row outside this
 *     job's scope filter, so this is the one path that can repair it. A stored FY
 *     is never rewritten, not even a differently-spelled one.
 *   - a pair the table does not hold is **inserted**. `itemName` comes from
 *     `resolveItemNames` (`lib/erpItemNameLookup.ts`) — the name the item was
 *     supplied under before, else the ERP master name. Only when no source knows
 *     the code does it stay blank, and that is counted in `unnamedInserts`. An
 *     insert whose resolved name collides with a row the invoice already has is
 *     counted in `blockedInserts` (the DB unique key is `(invoiceNo, itemName)`).
 *   - `invoiceNo`, `itemName`, `financialYear` are never overwritten on an
 *     existing row. Nothing is ever deleted. `syncedAt` is stamped only on rows
 *     actually written.

 * `FSD040113` and `FSD040050` both read `SLUICE VALVE-...-STANDARD_65_PN-10/16`
 * on `GD26Y-00126`), and the table can hold only one of them per invoice. Rather
 * than lose the second, its quantity is added to the survivor — exactly what
 * happens when the same code is listed twice.
 *
 * **The key is the ERP master name** (`masterNameByCode`, from
 * `resolveMasterNames`), never the stored supply name. That distinction matters:
 * `FVC030011` (`..._150_...`) and `FVC030012` (`..._200_...`) are different
 * products whose *stored* names both read `..._200` because one is mislabelled.
 * Folding on the stored name merged a 150 mm into a 200 mm, and a gear box into
 * an O-ring. Folding on the master name leaves those alone while still folding
 * the genuine duplicates. A row whose code has no master name is never folded —
 * there is no trustworthy key for it.
 *
 * Only folds when **everything except the quantity and the item code is the
 * same** (uom, LR, canonical state, consignee address, account code). If those
 * differ, the two rows are genuinely different entries and are left alone for the
 * normal refusal path.
 *
 * Pure: no database access, so the rule is unit-tested directly.
